Nicotine+ is a client for the SoulSeek filesharing network. It was "forked"
from Nicotine, Hyriand's Soulseek client, which in turn was forked from the
PySoulSeek project by Alexander Kanavin.

After installing nicotine (see INSTALL for that), the executable
to run is named 'nicotine'.

General Usage:
 To bring up a context menu for items is a list, select them with the left
 mousebutton first, and then right-click to bring up the context menu. These
 menus will only show options available in the context of the selected items
 (f.e. if you select search results from multiple users, actions on the user
 will not be available). Pressing the tab key in a chatroom or a private chat
 invokes nickname auto-completion.

PySoulSeek Config:
 If you want Nicotine to use your PySoulSeek configuration files, use:

# nicotine -c ~/.pyslsk

The homepage of PySoulSeek is: http://sensi.org/~ak/pyslsk/

ps. Please remember, not sharing kills P2P!
