Nicotine+ is a client for the SoulSeek filesharing network. It was "forked"
from Nicotine, Hyriand's Soulseek client, which in turn was forked from the
PySoulSeek project by Alexander Kanavin.

Dependencies:
 To use it on Linux/Unix and X11 you'll need the following:

 Required:
  * An X server            http://www.x.org/
  * Gtk+ 2.10 or newer     http://www.gtk.org/
  * Python 2.2.3 or newer  http://www.python.org/
  * pygtk-2.10 or newer (may work with older version, but is *UNTESTED*)
    http://www.pygtk.org/
  * python-mutagen         https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen

 Optional:
  * GeoIP python bindings (Country lookup) http://www.maxmind.com/app/python
  * Psyco (speeds up Python code) http://psyco.sourceforge.net/
  * TrayIcon (included with Nicotine+) is a System Tray app that requires a
    Python module to be compiled. Read README.trayicon for more information.
    However, with PyGTK 2.10, that module is no longer used. Instead,
    gtk.SystemIcon is used.

After installing nicotine (see INSTALL for that), the executable
to run is named 'nicotine'.

General Usage:
 To bring up a context menu for items is a list, select them with the left
 mousebutton first, and then right-click to bring up the context menu. These
 menus will only show options available in the context of the selected items
 (f.e. if you select search results from multiple users, actions on the user
 will not be available). Pressing the tab key in a chatroom or a private chat
 invokes nickname auto-completion.

Config Conversion:
 If you wish to import your config from the official Windows client,
 use the nicotine-import-winconfig script. Read the README.import-winconfig
 for more information.

PySoulSeek Config:
 If you want Nicotine to use your PySoulSeek configuration files, use:

# nicotine -c ~/.pyslsk
