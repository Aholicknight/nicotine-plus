# TODO

A list of stuff & things todo (not in any particular order):

#### Short term goals

* Make as much as possible optional dependencies work on Windows.

#### Long term goals

* Reach out for translation help.
* Replace db files (causing many problems) by something easier like json.
* Switch from legacy GeoIP (maintenance mode) to a good alternative, perhaps
  python3-geoip2.
