# TODO

A list of stuff & things todo (not in any particular order):

#### Short term goals

* Our sounds are dropped by downstream packagers for being non-free: investigate.
* Convert old (unmaintained) python-GeoIP code to an up to date version.
* Curate and update embedded plugins.

#### Long term goals

* Update the wiki.
* Reach out for translation help.
* Switch to Gstreamer 1.X (require GTK3).
* Switch spellcheck to gspell (require GTK3).
* Replace the bundle Configparser module by something easier like json.
* Replace db files (causing many problems) by something easier like json.
* **IN PROGRESS**: Make as much as possible optional dependencies work on Windows.

#### Windows specific goals

* Refresh the NSIS installer icons.
