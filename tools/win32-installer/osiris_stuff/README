Steps:
 1. Install all dependencies (Python 2.4 is the best choice for getting all 
    dependencies as of 7th March 2007) 
    1A. If you choose not to use Python 2.4, modify make_exe.bat, make_exe.py 
        and installerscript.nsi to reflect the dll name changes, path changes, 
        dll removals and additions. 
    1B. If a dependency for your chosen version of Python doesn't exist, you'll
        have to remove it.
 2. Copy all files from this directory to the 'tools' subdirectory in the
    nicotine+ source directory.
 3. Modify the version in the installerscript.nsi with a text editor
 4. Modify version in wizard.xcf (save as Wizard.bmp)

 5. Run make_exe.bat and press a key when the processed is paused
 6. Compile installerscript.nsi
 7. Test installation, uninstallation
 8. Done
