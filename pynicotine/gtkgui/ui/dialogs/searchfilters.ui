To set the filter, press Enter after typing or clearing your terms. The filter applies immediately to the already received results, and to any more that are returned thereafer. The full results from the server are always available if you clear the filter of all terms. You do not need to perform another search to apply a different filter.

You can filter by:

- Included text:
      Files are shown if they contain this text.
      Case is insensitive, but word order is important.
      &apos;Spears Brittany&apos; will not show any &apos;Brittany Spears&apos;

- Excluded text:
      As above, but files will not be displayed if the text matches

- Size:
      Shows results based on size. use &gt; and &lt; to find files larger or smaller.
      Files exactly the same as this term will always match.
      Use = to specify an exact match. Use k or m to specify kilo or megabytes.
      &gt;10M will find files larger than 10 megabytes.
      &lt;4000k will find files smaller than 4000k.

- Bitrate:
      Find files based on bitrate. Use &lt; and &gt; to find lower or higher.
      &gt;192 finds 192 and higher, &lt;192 finds 192 or lower.
      =192 only finds 192.
      For VBR, the average bitrate is used.

- Free slot:
      Show only those results from users which have at least
      one upload slot free.</property>
